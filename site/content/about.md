My name is Han Chiang, a Computer Science undergraduate based in Singapore.  
My interest is in the area of web development. I care about building websites and applications that are robust, user friendly, and comply with the industry practices.  
  
I have worked with javascript, node.js, AWS(API gateway, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Cognito), react, react native, using them to build real world applications.  
I am also continually exploring various technologies, such as Hugo, a static website generator, which this website is based on.
